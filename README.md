üöÄ Key Features
Automated Data Pipeline: Ingests and cleans data from a raw CSV (googleplaystore.csv) and a live API (App Store Scraper).

Cross-Platform Analysis: Unifies Android and iOS app data into a single dataset for powerful market comparison.

AI-Powered Insights: Uses a Large Language Model (Groq) to generate strategic market insights from the combined data.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly Streamlit application to visualize insights and explore the data.

Adaptable Pipeline (Phase 5): The system is repurposed to analyze a D2C e-commerce dataset, calculating key business KPIs.
